New Relic is a powerful observability platform with Micrometer
https://github.com/newrelic/micrometer-registry-newrelic[support through its NewRelicRegistry implementation].
Micrometer metrics are converted into New Relic dimensional metrics, which can be
displayed in dashboards and used to create alerts.  The New Relic platform supports
full programmability in addition to custom queries with the NRQL language.

NOTE: Please use the New Relic provided `NewRelicRegistry` instead of Micrometer's `NewRelicMeterRegistry`. The instructions here
are for the current https://github.com/newrelic/micrometer-registry-newrelic[New Relic registry].

== Installing

First, set your project to depend on the New Relic Micrometer registry:

=== Maven

[source,xml,subs=+attributes]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.newrelic.telemetry</groupId>
  <artifactId>micrometer-registry-new-relic</artifactId>
  <version>${newrelic-registry.version}</version>
</dependency>
----


== Configuring

[source,java]
----
NewRelicConfig newRelicConfig = new NewRelicConfig() {
    @Override
    public String accountId() {
        return "MYACCOUNT";
    }

    @Override
    public String apiKey() {
        return "MY_INSIGHTS_API_KEY";
    }

    @Override
    public String get(String k) {
        return null; // accept the rest of the defaults
    }
};

MeterRegistry registry = new NewRelicMeterRegistry(newRelicConfig, Clock.SYSTEM);
----

There are two distinct sources of API keys in New Relic.

`NewRelicConfig` is an interface with a set of default methods. If, in the implementation of `get(String k)`, rather than returning `null`, you  instead bind it to a property source, you can override the default configuration. For example, Micrometer's Spring Boot support binds properties prefixed with `management.metrics.export.newrelic` directly to the `NewRelicConfig`:

[source,yml]
----
management.metrics.export.newrelic:
    account-id: MYACCOUNT
    api-key: MY_INSIGHTS_API_KEY

    # The interval at which metrics are sent to New Relic. See Duration.parse for the expected format.
    # The default is 1 minute.
    step: 1m
----

== Graphing

This section serves as a quickstart to rendering useful representations in New Relic for metrics originating in Micrometer. See the https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/insights/nrql-new-relic-query-language/using-nrql/introduction-nrql[New Relic NRQL docs] for a far more complete reference of what is possible in New Relic.

=== Timers

At each publishing interval, the New Relic `Timer` produces a single event with the timer's name and several attributes:

1. `avg` - A mean latency for the publishing interval.
2. `count` - Throughput per second over the publishing interval.
3. `totalTime` - Total time per second over the publishing interval (used with `count`) to create aggregable means.

Additionally, if any percentiles or SLA buckets are defined on the timer, additional events are produced:

4. `${name}.percentiles` - Micrometer calculated percentiles for the publishing interval. One event is produced for each percentile, with a tag of `phi` in the range [0,1].
5. `${name}.histogram` - One event is produced for each SLA boundary with a tag of 'le', indicating that it represents a cumulative count of events less than or equal to SLA boundaries over the publishing interval.

To generate an aggregable view of latency in New Relic, divide `totalTime` by `count`:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT sum(totalTime)/sum(count) as 'Average Latency', max(max) as 'Max' FROM timer since 30 minutes ago TIMESERIES auto
----

.Timer latency.

To generate a throughput chart:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT average(count) as 'Average Throughput' FROM timer since 30 minutes ago TIMESERIES auto
----

.Timer throughput.
image::img/new-relic-timer-throughput.png[New Relic-rendered timer throughput]

To generate a plot of client-side percentiles:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT latest(value) from timerPercentile FACET phi since 30 minutes ago TIMESERIES auto
----

.Timer Percentiles.
image::img/new-relic-timer-percentiles.png[New Relic-rendered percentiles]

Note how these percentiles are _not aggregable_. We've selected the `latest(value)` function to display this chart (i.e. it isn't correct to `average(value)` on a percentile value). The more dimensions you add to a timer, the less useful these values become.

Lastly, if you define SLA boundaries with the fluent builder for `Timer`, you can view throughput below certain SLA boundaries. In this example, we set SLA boundaries at 275 (yellow), 300 (red), and 500 (blue) milliseconds for a simulated `Timer` that is recording samples normally distributed around 250 ms. These counts represent the rate/second of samples less than or equal to each SLA boundary.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT sum(value) from timerHistogram FACET le since 30 minutes ago TIMESERIES auto
----

.Timer SLA boundaries.
image::img/new-relic-timer-sla.png[New Relic-rendered SLA boundaries]

Where the lines converge at various points it is evident that no sample exceeded the 275 ms SLA boundary.
